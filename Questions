6. How do you validate a form in MVC ? (dont remember the excat question here but the interviewr wants to know if i know the concept of
DataAnnotations and Model validation and can we have client and server validation ( enableClientValidation = false) related concept.
7. Scenario : Design a page similar to how cricbuzz page is : For every specific interval of time the a part of page should update with data coming from server 
	My answer was i will use ajax and paint the DOM with the response-- this is a very heavy approach
	Interviewr suggested that we can make use of partial pages concept in this scenario.
8. Write a CSS that behaves differently in different browsers.
9. Difference between IENUMERABLE and IQUERYABLE
10. if we declare a variable in c# like var test = "string", when does the data type binding occur ? Is it at compile time or run time ? A: compile time.
11. What is the difference between ViewBag, ViewData, TempData.
12. what is CORS?
13. How will you test an API ? My answer was i wil make use of Fiddler, Postman, tools apart from this, i can also send this from a browser window and also hit it 
from javascript using XmlHttpRequestObject
14. We need to pass list of objects of differen types to input to a web api ? how will u do it ? Question was {Class1Obj,Class2Obj,Class3Obj} this should be the input to api,
how will u pass it ? My answer was i will create another class that encompasses these 3 classes InpClass { Class1, Class2, Class3 } as a Model and pass this. interviewr was not 
OK with this as we are creating a new class..not sure the correct answer ?
15.Why do we need an interface ? why cant we write all things in a class? 
I said many reasons.. but one things in invented here was to achieve Liskov substitution principle in SOLID we need to implement code in interfaces .
One more scenario is if u write a method whch returns multiple types of objects ddepending on conditinos we can make one interface and make all those classes
implement it and put return type of the method as interface.
16. MethodOVerloading vs MethodOverriding.
17. which one of data retrival is faster , LINQ or ADO.net ? A: My take was LINQ as i thought i need not write old ado.net code.. but mentioned that internally linq
uses ado,net to establish connection and run query ... despite not giving a point to point answer, i gave a logical conclusion that it may be linq.
But both are eqaully faster depending on what we fire .. linq has over head of creating the manyual sql to fire on DB.
